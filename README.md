# Hartree-Fock Implementation in Python

This repository contains a pedagogical implementation of a restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) program written in Python.

## Features
- Input parsing
- Construction of one- and two-electron integrals
- SCF procedure
- Fock matrix construction
- Convergence control
- Energy calculation

## Purpose
This code was developed during my early academic career research to deepen my understanding of electronic structure theory and to translate formal quantum chemistry theory into working numerical algorithms.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy

## Author
